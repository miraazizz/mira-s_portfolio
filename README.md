# [Project 1: Flood Frequency Analysis using Extreme Value Distribution in Peninsular Malaysia Based on L-moment Method](https://github.com/miraazizz/fyp.git)

This is a project I did for my degree research, final year project, where I find the best distribution among three extreme value distribution to mitigate flood issue.

* The data was taken from offline source, Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia.
* Methodology: Applied Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Pareto (GPA), and Generalized Logistic (GLO) distributions using L-moments.
* Tools Used: R (lmomco package), Excel, Data Visualization
* Key Insights: Identified the best-fit model for flood risk assessment.

**Project 2: Predicting Customer Purchase Behavior**
Objective: to develope a predictive model to analyze customer buying patterns and improve sales forecasting.

* Methodology: Regression Analysis, Decision Trees, Classification Models
* Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Tableau, SQL
* Key Insights: Achieved high accuracy in predicting repeat customers.
