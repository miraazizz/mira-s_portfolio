# [Project 1: Flood Frequency Analysis using Extreme Value Distribution in Peninsular Malaysia Based on L-moment Method](https://github.com/miraazizz/fyp.git)
This is a project I did for my degree research, final year project, where I find the best distribution among three extreme value distribution to mitigate flood issue.

* The data was taken from offline source, Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia.
* Methodology: Applied Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Pareto (GPA), and Generalized Logistic (GLO) distributions using L-moments.
* Tools Used: RStudio (lmomco package), Excel, Data Visualisation, SPSS
* Key Insights: Identified the best-fit model for flood risk assessment.
